      functionalities as intended.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Description of the bot</h2>
    <p>
      Watchtower is an automatic AI moderation bot designed to help manage

    <p>
      <strong>Configuration and Actions:</strong>
      You are solely responsible for configuring the Bot's settings on your

      of the hosted
      <em>service</em>

    <h2>7. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE PORTUGUESE LAW, THE LICENSOR
      (TIAGO) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,

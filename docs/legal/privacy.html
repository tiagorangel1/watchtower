    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Effective date:</strong>
      June 21, 2025
    </p>

    <h2>Your messages should be private</h2>
    <p>
      We believe you should be able to talk without compromising your privacy.
      But to provide effective AI moderation with Watchtower, we sometimes need
      to analyze message content — like checking for toxicity or harmful
      behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's how Watchtower works: your server data is stored securely on our
      servers in Europe. When Watchtower analyzes a message for moderation, only
      the message content is briefly sent to our trusted AI partners (Jigsaw and
      OpenAI). These partners analyze the content and return moderation scores
      in seconds, helping keep your server safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal is to keep your data secure while keeping your server protected.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy by design</h2>
    <p>
      Watchtower is built to protect your data. These four principles guide
      everything we do:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Your data stays minimal.</strong>
        <br />
        We only collect what's necessary: server IDs, user IDs for moderation
        actions, and server configurations. Message content is never stored by
        Watchtower — it's only sent for analysis and then discarded.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Your data is only shared when needed.</strong>
        <br />
        When a message needs moderation analysis, we only send the message
        content to our AI partners (Jigsaw and OpenAI). They are instructed not
        to store your data — we have have an agreement with Jigsaw to not store
        your messages, and OpenAI doesn't store data from their moderation
        endpoint. Analysis happens in real-time for safety.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>You can control your data.</strong>
        <br />
        Server administrators can configure Watchtower's settings or remove the
        bot entirely. Moderation logs are automatically deleted after a few
        days. You can request data deletion by contacting us, and we'll process
        it promptly.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Your data is not for sale.</strong>
        <br />
        We will never sell your personal data. Period. We only use it to provide
        accurate and helpful moderation for your Discord server.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>When we analyze messages</h2>
    <p>
      Message content is analyzed in real-time when Watchtower's AI moderation
      features are triggered. This helps us identify potentially harmful content
      like toxicity, harassment, or spam. We really appreciate your trust, and
      take extra steps to maintain your privacy throughout the process.
    </p>

    <p>Here's how it works:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        When message content is analyzed, it's sent to AI partners but never
        stored by Watchtower or the AI services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only moderation results are kept temporarily in memory to inform
        moderation decisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moderation logs are automatically deleted from our servers after a few
        days.
      </li>
      <li>
        Watchtower avoids processing messages from sensitive contexts when
        possible.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As your server uses Watchtower, you remain in control. Server
      administrators can adjust moderation settings or remove the bot at any
      time in Discord's server settings.

    <hr />

    <p>
      Welcome to Watchtower! This privacy policy explains how Watchtower ("we,"
      "us," "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information in relation
      to our Watchtower Discord bot ("bot," "service"). This privacy policy
      should be read in conjunction with our terms of service. By adding
      Watchtower to your Discord server or using its commands, you agree to the
      collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      All data for the Watchtower bot is controlled by Tiago Rangel. If you have
      any questions about this privacy policy or our data practices, please
      contact us using the email above.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      We collect certain information to provide and improve the Watchtower
      service. The information we collect includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Server information:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Server ID:</strong>
            We collect the Discord server ID when Watchtower is added to a
            server. This is necessary to associate bot configurations and
            operations with the correct server.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Server configurations:</strong>
            Any settings you configure for Watchtower on your server (e.g.,
            moderation thresholds, enabled features, log channels) are stored to
            ensure the bot functions as you've customized it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User information:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User ID:</strong>
            We collect Discord user IDs of individuals interacting with or
            affected by the bot's moderation features. This is used to apply
            moderation actions correctly and to log such actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Record of previous automated moderation actions:</strong>
            We store a record of automated moderation actions taken by the bot
            concerning a user ID. This helps in contextualizing future
            moderation decisions and providing a moderation history.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Message content (for moderation):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Watchtower itself
            <strong>does not store</strong>
            the content of user messages on its own servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            For its AI moderation features, full message content is sent for
            analysis to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Perspective API (Google/Jigsaw):</strong>
                We use the Perspective API to analyze message content for
                potential toxicity or harmful content.
                <code>doNotStore</code>
                is set to
                <code>true</code>
                for these requests, instructing Perspective API not to store the
                message content. You can learn more about Google's privacy
                practices

                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>OpenAI moderation endpoint:</strong>
                We use OpenAI's moderation endpoint to analyze message content.
                OpenAI's policy states they do not store data sent to their
                moderation endpoint. You can learn more about OpenAI's privacy
                practices
                <a
                  href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy"
                  target="_blank"

                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The analysis results from these services (e.g., a toxicity score,
            flags) are used by Watchtower to determine if moderation action is
            needed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Moderation action logs:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When Watchtower takes a moderation action (either automatically via
            AI or based on server configuration), we log the following:
            <ul>
              <li>The user ID of the user affected.</li>
              <li>
                The reason for the action (e.g., AI trigger, specific rule
                violated).
              </li>
              <li>The timestamp of the action.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            This information is stored in our database to provide the service
            (e.g., for server administrators to review moderation history).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>IP address hashing (for anti-raid):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To help protect servers from coordinated malicious activity (raids),
            we may collect user IDs and process associated IP addresses to
            generate and store a cryptographic hash of the IP address.
          </li>
          <li>
            This hashed IP data, linked with user IDs, is used solely for the
            purpose of identifying and mitigating raid activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Raw IP addresses are not stored by Watchtower.</strong>
            The hashing process is non-reversible.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Commands and interactions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We do not log the specific command strings users input to interact
            with Watchtower (e.g., configuration commands). However, actions
            resulting from commands that lead to moderation are logged as
            described under "moderation action logs."
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>To provide and maintain the service:</strong>
        To operate Watchtower's automatic AI moderation features, apply
        server-specific configurations, and ensure the bot functions as
        intended.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>To enforce server rules:</strong>
        To automatically detect and act upon content or behavior that violates
        configured server rules or general safety guidelines, based on AI
        analysis and server settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For server administration:</strong>
        To allow server administrators to view moderation logs and understand
        actions taken by the bot.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For security and anti-raid:</strong>
        To protect servers from abuse, such as spam, raids, or other malicious
        activities, including through the use of IP address hashing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>To improve the service:</strong>
        While raw message content is not stored by us, aggregated or anonymized
        insights from moderation actions may help us understand common issues
        and refine the bot's effectiveness (though this is not the primary use
        of individual data points).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our legal basis for processing this data is primarily our legitimate
      interest in providing a functional, secure, and effective moderation bot,
      and to fulfill our service obligations to users who add the bot to their
      server.
    </p>

    <h2>4. How we share your information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We share information only in the
      following limited circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>With third-party AI service providers:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As detailed in section 2, full message content is sent to
            Perspective API (Google/Jigsaw) and OpenAI's moderation endpoint for
            analysis. This sharing is solely for the purpose of enabling the AI
            moderation features of Watchtower. Both services are instructed not
            to store the message content (Perspective via the
            <code>doNotStore=true</code>
            flag, and OpenAI by their policy for the moderation endpoint). We
            are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third
            parties, and we encourage you to review their privacy policies
            linked in section 2.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>With server administrators:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Moderation logs (including the affected user ID, reason, and
            timestamp) are accessible to the administrators of the Discord
            server where the action occurred. This is essential for server
            management and transparency. Server configurations are also
            inherently tied to the server.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For legal reasons:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in
            the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: comply with
            a legal obligation (e.g., a subpoena or court order); protect and
            defend our rights or property; prevent or investigate possible
            wrongdoing in connection with the service; protect the personal
            safety of users of the service or the public; or protect against
            legal liability.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Watchtower is self-hosted on a server located in the jurisdiction of
      Portugal. Beyond the AI service providers mentioned above, we do not share
      data with other third-party hosting services for the primary storage of
      bot data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data storage, security, and retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data storage location:</strong>
        Data collected and managed directly by Watchtower (such as server
        configurations, moderation action logs, and IP hashes) is stored on a
        self-hosted server located in the jurisdiction of Portugal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data security:</strong>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the information we store from
        loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
        destruction. As Watchtower is open-source, its code is available for
        public review, which can contribute to identifying and addressing
        security vulnerabilities. However, no internet-based service is 100%
        secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data retention:</strong>
        We retain data for the following periods:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Server configurations:</strong>
            Retained as long as Watchtower is on your server, or until you
            request deletion of specific configurations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Moderation action logs (including user ID, reason, timestamp):
            </strong>
            Retained for approximately 1 to 7 days to allow server
            administrators adequate time for review and then automatically
            deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IP hashes (linked to user IDs for anti-raid):</strong>
            Retained as long as necessary for active anti-raid protection or for
            a period aligning with moderation action logs if an action results
            from this data (typically 1 to 7 days).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              User IDs and associated past moderation actions (as a general
              record):
            </strong>
            Retained in line with the moderation action logs to provide context
            for ongoing moderation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your data protection rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location (particularly if you are in the European
      Economic Area - EEA), you have certain data protection rights. We aim to
      take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the
      use of your personal data.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to access:</strong>
        You have the right to request copies of your personal data that we hold.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to rectification:</strong>
        You have the right to request that we correct any information you
        believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to erasure (right to be forgotten):</strong>
        You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under
        certain conditions. For example, moderation logs are automatically
        deleted after a short period, but you can request earlier deletion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong>
        You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your
        personal data, under certain conditions.

        <strong>Right to object to processing:</strong>
        You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data,

        interests as our legal basis.

      Please note that some data may be exempt from such requests if we have a

    <h2>7. Children's privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Watchtower is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 (or
      the applicable minimum age requirement in your jurisdiction and as per
      Discord's terms of service). We do not knowingly collect personally
      identifiable information from children under this age. If we become aware
      that we have collected personal data from a child without verification of
      parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our
      servers.
    </p>

    <h2>8. International data transfers</h2>
    <p>
      While Watchtower's primary data storage is in Portugal (EEA), the use of
      third-party AI services (Perspective API by Google and OpenAI moderation
      endpoint) involves the transfer of message content to these providers,
      which may operate servers outside of the EEA (e.g., in the United States).
    </p>
    <p>
      These transfers are necessary for providing the AI moderation features of
      the bot. Google and OpenAI have their own measures in place to ensure that
      data transferred internationally is protected in accordance with
      applicable data protection laws (e.g., through standard contractual
      clauses or other approved transfer mechanisms). By using Watchtower, you
      acknowledge that your message content will be processed by these services
      as described.
    </p>
    <p>Encryption (HTTPS) is used for data in transit to these services.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new privacy policy on the dedicated webpage
      where this policy is hosted. We will update the "effective date" at the
      top of this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any
      changes. Changes to this privacy policy are effective when they are posted
      on this page. Your continued use of the bot after any modifications to the
      privacy policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications
      and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified privacy policy.
